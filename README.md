#Employee Management System

An employee management system built in core Java would typically encompass various functionalities to efficiently handle employee-related tasks within an organization. Here's a description of the components and features such a system might include:

Employee Information Management:
The system would allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of employee profiles.
Information such as name, address, contact details, job title, department, salary, and other relevant details would be stored and managed.
Authentication and Authorization:
Secure login functionality to ensure only authorized personnel can access the system.
Different levels of access control based on user roles (e.g., admin, manager, employee) to manage who can perform specific actions within the system.
Attendance Tracking:
Recording employee attendance, including clock-in and clock-out times.
Calculation of work hours, overtime, and leave taken.
Leave Management:
Employees can request different types of leave (e.g., sick leave, vacation, maternity/paternity leave).
Managers can approve or reject leave requests, with notifications sent to both parties.
Payroll Processing:
Calculation of employee salaries based on factors like hours worked, overtime, leave taken, and any other applicable parameters.
Generation of pay stubs or salary slips for employees.
